        <p><i>Interesting facts about pigeons</i></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</li>
            <li> Despite the social perception as dirty and disease-ridden, pigeons are actually very clean animals and there is very little evidence to suggest that they are significant transmitters of disease.</li>
            <li>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</li>
